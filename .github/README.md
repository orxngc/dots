# orangc's flake

> [!CAUTION]
> This flake is extremely unstable and prone to breaking changes..
> I do ***not*** recommmend using this/installing it, it will definitely break.
> However, going through my code for little bits and things to borrow or learn from is totally fine.
> A process of rewriting my entire configuration starts
> after commit [`09709dc7f716bf1df7c836dfc191e88ec1ad8339`](https://github.com/orangci/dots/commit/09709dc7f716bf1df7c836dfc191e88ec1ad8339).

<!-- ## Installation

Run this command in your terminal and the script will handle the rest. Note that this won't work for non NixOS users. If the script breaks in anyway, please make an issue and notify me. It shouldn't, though.

```sh
nix-shell -p curl # You can skip to the next line if you already have curl installed.
sh <(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orxngc/dots/main/install.sh)
```

Note: I strongly advise you to read the code of the script [here](github.com/orxngc/dots/blob/main/install.sh) before running it. Always read and thoroughly check scripts you see online for your own safety..!

Press `SUPER + ?` to open a list of all keybindings.

## Structure Overview

This is a very modular flake.

- [`.github`](.github) The assets files for the README.
- [`files`](files) Files which various home-manager modules utilize.
  - [`fonts`](files/fonts) This is where you can place fonts that are not available in nixpkgs.
- [`hm-modules`](hm-modules) All home-manager modules are stored in here.
  - [`core`](hm-modules/core) Important things, like the hyprland module.
  - [`programs`](hm-modules/programs) The majority of program modules.
  - [`styles`](hm-modules/styles) Now this one you should touch. A big chunk of the system is themed here (the rest are themed in hm-modules/programs).
- [`hosts`](hosts) This is where each host's unique configurations go. You can configure/toggle the different modules and hm-modules for each host here.
- [`modules`](modules) NixOS system modules.
  - [`core`](modules/core) There's no reason to touch this.
  - [`drivers`](modules/core) Again, no reason to touch these.
  - [`programs`](modules/programs) Honestly not a reason to touch these either.
- [`scripts`](scripts) This is where I store all my scripts.
- [`flake.nix`](flake.nix) Where the flake begins, the lovely starting pont.
